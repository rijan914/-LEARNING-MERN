JavaScript
    - Synchronous 
    - single threaded 
    - blocking language
    - is a dynamic language because a variable can store different value in different point of time

Data types: 
     a. number : 1, 2, 34,34.34
     b. boolean : true , false
     c. string : enclosed by double quote ("  ") eg: "a", "b" , "c" , "abc@", "true"
     d. undefined :
        In JavaScript, undefined is considered a falsy value.
        This means that when undefined is used in a context where a boolean value is expected (like an if statement or logical operation), it is treated as false.     

Function: 
    - by default function will return undefined value 
    - 

NAME CONVENTION:
